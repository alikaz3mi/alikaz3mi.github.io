## Professional Experience

**ParsTech AI — Product Tech Lead**  
*Mashhad, Iran*  
Jul 2020 - Present

**AI Tech Lead**
- **R&D Leadership & Mentoring**: Lead a cross-functional research and engineering team of 15 members (AI, Backend, Frontend, DevOps). Established Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles, mirroring the "Quality Assurance" requirements of large-scale research frameworks.
- **Strategic Innovation**: Spearheaded the transition from monolithic architectures to microservices, enabling horizontal scalability and 99.9% uptime.
- **DevOps & Governance**: Enforced rigorous CI/CD pipelines, TDD (Test-Driven Development), and containerization (Docker/Kubernetes), reducing deployment cycles from days to hours.

**ParsChat Product Tech Lead**  
Nov 2022 - Present
- Lead a 15-member team; designed and implemented microservice-based ML infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines.
- **Scale & Architecture**: Architected a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system serving 200+ active enterprise users. Designed the vector retrieval pipeline to handle custom, domain-specific client requirements with high availability.
- **Healthcare & Dermatology Pipelines**: Developed specialized inference models for healthcare and cosmetic decision support. Engineered a personality-based filtering algorithm that adapts recommendations to user behavioral profiles, ensuring "human-centric" AI interaction.
